=====Contributing=====

Sections are split using namespaces and you're free to create pages under each namespace we have set up.  To start you simply need to edit the :start page of the namespace and add an internal link.  You need to be logged in to do this, then simply go to one of the sections (listed below) and edit the top level page.  To create an internal link you put the new page name surrounded by double square brackets like <nowiki>[[new page]]</nowiki>.  When you save and click on your new link it will tell you the page doesn't exist, but the edit option to the right will allow you to create it.  

Common Syntax to use while building out pages

<row>
<col lg="6">
  * [[https://www.dokuwiki.org/wiki:syntax|Dokuwiki Syntax]] \\ Dokuwiki's simple markup language
  * [[http://www.lotar.altervista.org/wiki/wiki/plugin/bootswrapper| Bootstrap Wrapper]] \\ Add several Bootstrap components (Jumbotron, Alert, Panel, â€¦) to DokuWiki 
  * [[https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:bootnote| Bootnote]] \\ Create note with Bootstrap style

</col>
</row>

If you have ideas that can't be solved by creating a page just hop on [[https://discord.io/ubiquiti|Discord]] and let know.

====Sections====

===Tutorials and Guides===

This section, as the name suggests, is for full guides.  These can be full setups or individual functions, but should be more than just a tip or two.
\\
\\

===Tips and Tricks===

This section is for setup and operating tips as well as being a shared notebook of useful commands or procedures.

===Product Facts===

We don't want this section to be a duplication of data available on Ubiquiti's website or datasheets, but sometimes that information isn't quite right or non-existent. This section's goal is to collect information about their products that is spread through forums, blogs, and chat but not available on a more official source.

Please hotlink any datasheets for products so it's always an update to date version.  As such, try to keep other information on the products limited to what's not in the datasheets and date it in case of future updates.
