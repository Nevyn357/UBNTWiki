====== Unifi Switch Comparison ======

The Ubiquiti Support site has an official comparison:

https://help.ubnt.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037335694-UniFi-Switch-Model-Comparison

However that page sorts the data by generation and form factor. This page formats the data differently, so you can compare Gen1 vs Gen2 for each product category.
