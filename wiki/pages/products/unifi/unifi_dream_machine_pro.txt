===== Getting Started =====
  * In order to install Protect on the UDM-Pro, a hard drive must be installed and the machine rebooted. 
    * WARNING: All contents of the hard drive will be deleted once the UDM-Pro is rebooted and the drive is initialized for the first time.

===== Known Issues =====
  * Currently the LCD Module does not function and will continually cycle the Ubiquiti logo.
  * WAN SFP+ port does not currently NAT traffic, you must use the RJ45 port for upstream WAN connectivity.
  * The WAN & LAN SFP+ interfaces are hardware bound to the same speed. (You cannot have a 1gb SFP WAN & 10gb SFP+ LAN connectivity).
  * PPPoE & NAT issues are currently being troubleshooted by Ubiquiti staff.
  * Multi-WAN is not an option currently.
  * Restoring a backup from an external controller is not supported today.
  * Applying new settings to the UDM-Pro could interrupt WAN connectivity for approximately 2 seconds.
  * Speed Tests run from the controller on the UDM-Pro show inflated numbers and are not reliable at this time.
===== Troubleshooting tips =====
 **Log file locations are located in the following places**
  * /var/log/messages
  * /mnt/data/log
  * Additionally the executable **oopsdump** can be run to retrieve log files.
    * You can also execute the following command to TAR all logs that might be helpful for Ubiquiti - ''tar -czvf /mnt/data/logs.tar.gz /mnt/data/log/*''

 **SSH information**
    * Username = root
    * Password = Your UI account password used when you setup the device. 
    * NOTE: Changing your UI SSO password will update for authentication to the controller, but will NOT change the device SSH credentials. This means that it will continue to be the password you used when setting up the device.
