===== LED Status Light =====

    - **Blue - Solid**
      - Normal Operation

===== Getting Started =====

A special version of controller is required to adopt a USW-mini. [[https://community.ui.com/questions/Initial-setup-notes-for-USW-Mini/78e3fae7-3af2-499b-bfe3-4695e52e1939|Read on Community Forum]] 

Also, as of right now, custom controller versions are not available to UDM/UDM-Pro users, so therefore, USW-mini cannot currently be adopted to UDM/UDM-Pro configurations.

===== Known Issues =====

===== Troubleshooting tips =====

  - **No light/power**
    - Check power connection.
    - Are you connected to a PoE enabled switch or PoE injector?
  - **Can only connect to the primary/default VLAN**
      - Check that your switch port has all VLANs enabled (Try cycling the port through 'Disabled')
