==== Info ====

**Can you upgrade the HDD?**
  * "A small slider switch on the bottom ejects the hard drive. Tray is tool-free, just flex it a bit and drop the new hard drive in. System automatically reformats the drive and starts using it. Your recordings and settings will not be on the new hard drive (obviously) but we'll make it easy to migrate your settings. Kensington lock slot on the back also locks the HDD in place." [[https://community.ubnt.com/t5/UCK-G2-PLUS-Beta/Just-ordered-any-info-on-the-HDD-upgrade/m-p/2365241|Source]]
  * Tested with upto a 5TB Seagate. 
  * PoE [power limitations] dictates 2.5" HDDs.

**Will it suffer database corruption from power cycles?**
  * No, The [built in] battery cleanly shuts the system down [after it loses power for >5sec].

**Can I add NAS drives?**
  * Not officially supported (yet). But you can SSH in.

**2G vs 2G-PLUS**
  - the regular G2 does not host the video controller.
  - NOTE: There may be other unconfirmed changes.

**Does this support Unifi Video**
  * Unifi Protect does support existing 2G & 3G cameras.
  * It does not run UniFi Video 3.0
  * UniFi Protect currently only supports full-time recording, not motion-only recording. We will add these features to UniFi Protect in the coming months.

**What are the pins on the bottom for?**
  * A rack mount accessory that apparently will have connections built in that link to the unit via pins in the bottom. [[https://community.ubnt.com/t5/UniFi-Protect-Beta/UCK-G2-PLUS-Rack-Mountable/m-p/2365270/highlight/true#M144|Source]]

**Is the unit rack mountable?**
  * Yes. The UCK-G2-PLUS has some pins on the bottom for that purpose [rack mount]. They're hidden under a sticker in the photos. More info to come later [[https://community.ubnt.com/t5/UniFi-Protect-Beta/UCK-G2-PLUS-Rack-Mountable/m-p/2365270/highlight/true#M144|Source]]
