===== LED Status Light Ring =====

    - **Blue Ring - Solid**
      - Normal Operation 
    - **White Ring - Flashing**
      - Unconfigured state

===== Troubleshooting tips =====

  - **No light/power**
    - Check ethernet connection.
    - Are you connected to a PoE enabled switch or PoE injector?
    - Does the switch/injector have power?
  - **Can only connect to the primary/default VLAN**
      - Check that your switch port has all VLANs enabled (Try cycling the port through 'Disabled')


===== FAQ =====

  * **How many networks can I run off of this one AP?**
    * Up to 8 per Radio
  * **Does this AP come with a PoE injector for use on a non-PoE enabled switch?**
    * Yes!
      * <WRAP left round important 60%>
//NOTE: The 5pack version of this AP does NOT come with PoE injector, it is recommended to use them with a PoE enabled switch like the [[products:unifi:unifi_switch_8-150w|UniFi Switch 8-150W]] or better.//
