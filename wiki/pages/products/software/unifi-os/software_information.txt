====== Unifi OS - Software Information ======

Unifi OS isn't really an "OS" from a technical perspective. It will look different on different devices, but the end user experience will be the same. It's better to view the Unif OS was the Web UI that manages the devices and controllers running.

The first target device is UDM-Pro and it will be launched for general availability with UniFi OS pre-installed.
