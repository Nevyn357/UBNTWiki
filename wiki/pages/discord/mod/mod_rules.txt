====== Moderation Rules ======

<callout type="warning" title="Needs Review"> The content below is just capture the spirit of what we talked about. We need to fine tine the message and verbiage. I think "hard" details (like % for vote) will remove guess work and inconsistancy down the road.</callout>

We need to mimic the place we want to hang out, and treat others with respect.

We need to fight our urges to call people out despite how true it might be.

Moving forward all moderation actions will be called to a vote, if over half (? there are 17 with @mod right now) are online, then he majority ruling will move forward.

Use #the-corner has temporary ban until moderation has reached a verdict. Temp kick's / ban's are warranted for behavior that is illegal IRL or against Discord TOS. We should provide documentation (screenshots & one liner) as to why the kick / ban was performed.
