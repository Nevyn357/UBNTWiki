===== About Early Access =====

The purpose of the Ubiquiti Early Access Program is to provide customers with the opportunity to help evaluate new and upcoming features and updates of Ubiquiti products, allowing customers the chance to have access to features before they're publicly available and giving Ubiquiti the opportunity to fully test products in various real-world scenarios before being released.
