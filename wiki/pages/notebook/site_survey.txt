iOS:
  * Unfortunately Apple hides the wifi chip behind the API and does not let apps have much in the way of data from the chip. In iOS 11 Apple won't even let apps have access to the MAC Addresses in the ARP tabel. You can use the Airport Scanner tool to find Wifi networks but you will not get the same detailed information as the other devices.
