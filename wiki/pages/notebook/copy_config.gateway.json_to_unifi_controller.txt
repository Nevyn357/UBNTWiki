====== COPY CONFIG.GATEWAY.JSON TO UNIFI CONTROLLER ======

<bootnote warning>Adding a custom **config.gateway.json** could cause unintended consquences such as a provisioning loop on your USG. Please be careful and validate your file via **[[https://jsonlint.com/ | JSONlint]]** before creating or replacing on your controller; however, this **DOES NOT** promise proper provisioning...**ONLY** that the JSON is valid.</bootnote>


===== Mac OS X / Linux =====
  * Open Terminal on your machine
  * Navigate to the folder where the **config.gateway.json** file resides on your computer.
  * Enter the following :
      * <code>scp config.gateway.json <user>@x.x.x.x:~</code>
<bootnote>  
      * <user> - your user account on the UniFi Controller's operating system
      * x.x.x.x - UniFi Controller's IP
      * ~ - Path to <unifi-base> on controller (see below)
</bootnote>
